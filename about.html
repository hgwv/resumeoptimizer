            ResumeGlow AI was built by people who saw brilliant candidates get overlooked because their resumes were too generic. We
            help you translate your story into the language decision-makers value.

            <h3>Our story</h3>
            <p>
                We started ResumeGlow AI after reviewing thousands of resumes for fellowship and MBA
                programs. We realized that high-potential candidates struggled to turn complex projects
                into simple, compelling statements. Now we combine AI with human coaching to elevate the
                signal in every line.
